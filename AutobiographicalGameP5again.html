    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p> In this project, the objective was to design an autobiographical game, with three distinct scenes, 
        created using a combination of key and mouse interactions. The autobiographical
        element of the game was to focus on things important to one's own experience in their life,
        rather than their life story.
        Through this game, I wanted to focus on my experience of social anxiety.
         In this interpretation, the metaphor of the mind as a garden is used. 
         At first, the mind is shown lovely, untainted, with organic pathways, 
         as shown by the stone trail. However, through the small whisper heard 
         from outside the mind's garden, a sinister tone is taken upon this world.
         This paralleled with my experience of how much anxiety I often feel 
         overwhelm me by a small comment, and how much of it may take over my mind.
