    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p> In this project, we were assigned to use for loops, and nested for loops to create 
        patterns, as well as use if/else statements to animate the shapes for an optical illusion.
        In researching different optical illusions, I was entranced by several
         cyclical designs. I felt as though these especially resonated with my 
         personal beliefs surrounding cyclicism in life. In believing so, I pursued
          a cyclical but not completely linear animation, as I included moments of
           chaos as shown by the more erratic speeds of rotation. I continued to 
           exlore colors but I enjoyed the final blue-green natural scheme.
