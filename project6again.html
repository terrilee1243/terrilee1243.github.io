    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p> In this project, the objective was to create a data portrait out of a personal habit, 
        spending a week to gather data to base our visualization on. 
        I was tracking my habit of reading manga. It is rare that I don't read 
        manga everyday. I usually read while eating, or as a form of personal 
        rest.I tracked all the times I opened then closed chrome (in order to 
        read manga), and then added the total amount of minutes per day.
