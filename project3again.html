    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p> In this project, we were tasked to design an experimental clock- one that 
        did not pertain to the second, minute, hours according to the 24 hour cycle.
        My experimental clock is how I experience the typical day of what comes into 
        and out of my body- my very basic needs being met. It helps my keep track
         of when I need to meet basic needs of eating, drinking, breathing, and 
         going to the bathroom. The moving circle is a representation of me going 
         through the thoughts of all of my basic needs, and the elements passing 
         through my body in the day is listed chronologically and feeling-wise
          from top to bottom. </p>
